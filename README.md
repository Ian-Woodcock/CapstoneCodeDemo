# Capstone Project Code Demo
## Authors: Ian Woodcock & Carlos Nieves
### IDE: Visual Studio 2022
### Launguage: C++
#### Our code is in the CapstoneCodeDemo.cpp file in the CapstoneCodeDemo folder
#### The Visual Studio sln file is the CapstoneCodeDemo.sln if you wish to run the program yourself
#### No real issues, minor problems at the start due to me (Ian) forgetting to use the std namespace causing a bunch of stuff to not work but other than that no problems. We did go a bit faster than we had wanted in the video though.
##### Video presentation included in Cougarview Dropbox due to it being too bix for the github.
